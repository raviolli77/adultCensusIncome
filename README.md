## Process


This is a logistic regression analysis to find the relationship between race and income in the 1994 United States census. We predicted on fourteen variables. The categorical data was transformed into a numerical representation and our 'income' variable is represented with binary attributes. 

We created visuals that distinguish the difference between Causcasian and African American populations. 



## Analysis


## Logistic Regression

Logistic regression is a method of classification that involves a linear discriminant. This method outputs the probability of a given input belonging to a certain class. The central premise is the assumption that the input space can be separated into two regions: one for each class that is separated by a linear boundary. The cases are independent, and does not assume a linear relationship between the dependent variable and the independent variables. There is an assumption of a linear relationship between the logit of the explanatory variables and the response. Parameters are estimated using the maximum likelihood estimation.
